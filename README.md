# Artificial-Neural-Networks
This repository contains the from-scratch/independent implementations of sequential Artificial Neural Networks with different architectures, then these networks will perform on different classification tasks and compare the results with an equivalent PyTorch implemented network.

## Project Overview:
The purpose of this note book is to provide the ability to implement Artificial Neual Networks (ANN) from scratch, or in other words, implement a ANN independent of existing frameworks such as tensorflow or PyTorch.
The next step is about a shallow (not technical or exact) comparison between the independent model, and the equivalent model created by PyTorch in different tasks such as simple classification tasks and more complex classification tasks such as MNIST and CIFAR-10 classifications.
